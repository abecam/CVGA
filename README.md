# CVGA
The Collective of Video Game Artisans

The Web page will come here, currently being worked on using Hugo. All help appreciated and Hugo can be replaced, but it would be great for now to use a GitHub pages (so Jekyll, Hugo or any such template based CMS that can generate static HTML).

The Collective has for purpose to act as a publisher for small indie developer, also help regroup small content creators and indie devs (here), while not asking for any share of the revenue and not binding you with a contract (your game or content is yours, it is just represented by the CVGA).

Still, it would be great to get some kind of revenue, so we could have some more options. My current idea, as indie dev myself, is to sell my games and have CVGA helps for their visibility (as for everyone in the collective), but reinvest part of the revenue into it... But I am pretty far from that now :), so all idea is very welcome!

I initially thought of asking 5â‚¬ (roughly 5$) for joining, but I don't really see the point. I will still probably provide a Kofi link on the web-page as donations are good encouragements :).

## How it works (now) in Steam

You simply need to add a publisher called "The Collective of Video Game Artisans". No need to remove your main publisher. We probably need to define some bare minimum rules, but as a collective, we don't have any exclusivity. But that is probably not the case with a regular publisher, so be careful about that. If your publisher is ok with it, then so be it.
You join when you want, you leave when you want.
Now what we gain is being together, so having the possibility to have a list of related games for the collective. The goal is to be able to use more Steam marketings tools, such as sales for a publisher, so being able to, for instance, do a sale for racing games of the collective. So everything we can to raise our visibility.

So for now it is an idea and some solution, but more inputs would be absolutely great!
