# CVGA
The Collective of Video Game Artisans

The Web page will come here, currently being worked on using Hugo. All help appreciated and Hugo can be replaced, but it would be great for now to use a GitHub pages (so Jekyll, Hugo or any such template based CMS that can generate static HTML).

The Collective has for purpose to act as a publisher for small indie developer, also help regroup small content creators and indie devs (here), while not asking for any share of the revenue and not binding you with a contract (your game or content is yours, it is just represented by the CVGA).

Still, it would be great to get some kind of revenue, so we could have some more options. My current idea, as indie dev myself, is to sell my games and have CVGA helps for their visibility (as for everyone in the collective), but reinvest part of the revenue into it... But I am pretty far from that now :), so all idea is very welcome!

I initially thought of asking 5â‚¬ (roughly 5$) for joining, but I don't really see the point. I will still probably provide a Kofi link on the web-page as donations are good encouragements :).
