The Collective of Video Games Artisans (CGVA) is not a publisher but can act as one for small video games developers. It is there for having a chance of visibility between the big players, and to be able to use the same tools, such as special sales by genre, or a list of games by genre in the collective.

If you are a small indie developer, feel free to join! You can send us an email but already work on adding your game here! All games are in the /games folder in their own folder, you are free to create your own page if you are familiar with Hugo (with the Blowfish theme) or you can use the Python tool to create a standard page from your Steam page. If your game is not on Steam, you will need to create the page yourself.

What is the cost of joining us: fully free! But feel free to give a tip on Kofi, it would be a great encouragement :)

What do we take from the sale of your games: nothing! You still are the sole owner of your game and your sales goes fully to you (well, aside what the shop takes).

When can you leave: whenever you want! We are here to give you visibility. If you think you don't need us anymore, feel free to leave. Just send us an email so you can update the site (we can also keep your game there if you prefer).

Why am I doing that: 2 reasons: 

1. I am also an small indie dev and I am really bad at modern marketing. And I have seen how difficult it is to get any visibility being alone.

2. I am also a gamer, and I like a lot of indie game from very small studios. Many new ideas and great crafting comes from handcrafted games. Some of these games that I really enjoyed were most probably huge flops (though not as much as mine :) ), and that means that many of this great indies devs have to leave the industry... I would really like to see that change. A 3rd non personal reason would be the death of the true indie scene: many of the successful indie games are nowadays a product of bigger studios, or small studios with big publishers, or small studios with good connections. It's not an issue by itself, we all create games, but it buries the actual small actors!
